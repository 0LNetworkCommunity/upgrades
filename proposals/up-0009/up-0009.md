# UP-0009

Implements Proposal 2503-01
Changes a parameter on the threshold in which competitive bidding begins in Proof-of-Fee. During the experimental mode of PoF v0, there was a safety threshold where the competitive bidding only began when the count of candidate validators was greater than 21. This threshold is removed, and competition begins and the minimum viable validator count (four validators).

# Note on numbering
The previous proposal up-0005 used up sequence numbers 5, 6, 7, 8 for the upgrade. So this upgrade syncs versions with the available sequence number on chain. The code release number is unrelated (7.0.5).

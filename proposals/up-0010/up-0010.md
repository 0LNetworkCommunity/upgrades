# Upgrade Instructions

8.0.0 is a Hot Upgrade which only contains upgrades to system smart contracts.

Node software is also updated to 8.0.0, but not strictly necessary for upgrade (version 8 will work on version 7 node binaries).

# Workflow
Hot upgrades should follow this documentation: https://docs.openlibra.io/validators/hot-upgrades

## reproduce the artifacts:
```
libra move framework upgrade --output-dir ./ --framework-local-dir <path-to>/libra-framework/framework --danger-force-upgrade
```

## Motivation

Download [ OL-FILO-Recommendation.pdf](OL-FILO-Recommendation.pdf ) for the context of the proposal.

This upgrade proposal introduces significant policy-related changes centered around the First In, Last Out (FILO) principle â€” a foundational concept for the OL network. These changes were developed through extensive governance discussions from January to May 2025. Ultimately after two rounds of polling, the community voted unanimously in favor of adopting the policies.

The changes primarily affect how previous accounts are now converted to "Founder" accounts upon re-joining the network. Founder accounts are converted to slow wallets, which are reset with an unlocked amount available of zero. These founder accounts must go through a web of trust-based Sybil test before they can resume unlocking. No coins are lost in this process.

Additionally, this proposal implements enhanced controls for Community Wallets, requiring reauthorization from their donors while gaining the ability to utilize small amounts of unlocked coins through the donor voice mechanism.

These changes strengthen the integrity of the network by ensuring proper verification for rejoining accounts and improving the governance of community funds, all while preserving users' balances.


## Proposed Changes

1. Founder Account Migration from V7 v8
  - Requires manual signed transaction from user to create the necessary data structures on chain.

2. Slow Wallet Conversion for Founders
   - Converts all founder accounts to slow wallets with an initial unlocked amount reset to zero, with global unlock tracking

3. Community Wallet Periodic Authorization
   - Requires community wallets to be periodically reauthorized by their original donors

4. Community Wallet Unlocked Advance Loan
   - Allows donor voice to borrow up to 1% of unlocked balance with enhanced validation for payment proposals

5. Vouch Score - Web of Trust Sybil Test
   - Implements arbitrary and default roots of trust with periodic rotation, scoring-based limits, and page rank thresholds

6. VoteLib refactors
   - Refactors to turnout tally polls which impacted community wallet governance (reauthorization, veto, liquidation)

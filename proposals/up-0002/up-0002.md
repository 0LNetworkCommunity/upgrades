- DRAFT = Feedback collection

 
## Proposed Changes
 
During the v7.0.0 hard fork genesis the migration did not include the nominal_reward for Proof of Fee. This should have been included and led to validators recieving a much smaller
reward compared to before the network halted and the hard fork took place. This proposal is to remedy this and set the `nominal_reward` in the `ConsensusReward` struct to the value prior to the fork - 178204815(denominated in micro-libra)
 
1. Execute `proof_of_fee::genesis_migrate_reward` to adjust `nominal_reward` value

# UP-0016


##### Lazy mode


```
# vote on the proposal
libra txs governance vote --proposal-id 16

```


## Compatibility

There is no code change in up-16. It is only an administrative script to exit governance mode.

## Status

- PROPOSED

## Proposed Changes

Exits "governance mode". Governance mode is set by a system feature flag. The feature flag will be removed with this script.

## Script Hash

`0xcbb8ed3d5f3e387e812ed5ef3baa3540f5bbc12c9b132d58c20e17788133ce3d`

# Upgrade Instructions

No node software needs to be updated.

# Workflow

1. A proposer should craft a Move script from template, compile, and publish the artifacts.
https://docs.openlibra.io/guides/node-operators/validators/governance-tx#example-governance-mode

2. The proposer submits the proposal, the same steps as "hot upgrades" apply, see here:
https://docs.openlibra.io/guides/node-operators/validators/hot-upgrades

3. All voters should attempt to reproduce the payload above. Confirm the data in `script_sha3` matches the script hash in this document, see above.
https://docs.openlibra.io/guides/node-operators/validators/governance-tx#compile

4. All active validators vote
```
libra txs governance vote --proposal-id 16

```

## Reproducing the artifacts
The artifacts were build with:

1. IMPORTANT: modify the Move.toml at `proposals/up-0016/1-exit-gov-mode/Move.toml`, to include the full path to the OL libra-framework source code.

```
# in Move.toml

[dependencies.LibraFramework]
# DEVS: this must be the fully qualified path to the Libra Framework
local = '<PATH/TO/YOUR/libra-framework/framework/libra-framework'
```

2. Compile the script

```
# from this (the 'upgrades' project) root dir
libra move framework governance --script-dir ./proposals/up-0016/1-exit-gov-mode  --framework-local-dir <PATH/TO/YOUR/SOURCE/libra-framework/framework
```

### Proposing
```
# assuming you have this repo locally
cd <PATH/TO/YOUR>/upgrades/proposals/up-0015/1-libra-framework

libra txs governance propose \
--proposal-script-dir ./ \
--metadata-url https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/upgrades/blob/main/proposals/up-0016/up-0016.md
```

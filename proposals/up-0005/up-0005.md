# UP-0005

Implements Proposal 2502-01
Add governance mode feature flag to Move code. No p2p transfer transactions are
possible while governance mode is enabled.

##### Lazy mode


```
# vote on the proposal
libra txs vote --proposal-id 5

```

After proposal is finalized, another admin script is required to run
```
libra txs vote --proposal-id 8
```


## Compatibility

v7.0.4 is considered a "breaking" upgrade according to the Move compiler.
Note however, that there are no features which are breaking in a functional sense. This is the compiler's default behavior when certain functions have changed their signatures.
As such the upgrade script generation requires the modifier argument `--danger-force-upgrade`

## Status

- DEPLOYED

This proposal is to upgrade the libra-framework from 7.0.3 > 7.0.4

## Proposed Changes

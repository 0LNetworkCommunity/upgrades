# Overview

UP-0003

Implements Proposal 2408-01
supporting documentation: [Proposal_2408-01_Supporting_Documents.pdf](./Proposal_2408-01_Supporting_Documents.pdf)

## Compatibility

v7.0.3 is considered a "breaking" upgrade according to the Move compiler.
Note however, that there are no features which are breaking in a functional sense. This is the compiler's default behavior when certain functions have changed their signatures.
As such the upgrade script requires the modifier argument `--danger-for-upgrade`

## Status

- PROPOSED

This proposal is to upgrade the libra-framework from 7.0.2 > 7.0.3

## Proposed Changes
NOte: These changes only describe Move system smart contract policies. Full changelog can be seen at: https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/libra-framework/releases/tag/v7.0.3


The following is the changelog of this latest release:

# Upgrade Instructions

V7.0.3, contains upgrades to system smart contracts, and also node software updates.

Changes to node software are forwards and backward compatible. Validators can perform a rolling upgrade from any time.


## System Smart Contracts Upgrade

In v7.0.3 only libra-framework is being updated, not any underlying libraries.

Upgrades require three steps:


1. PROPOSE: Any validator can initialize the proposal using the proposal source

```
libra txs governance propose --proposal-script-dir <PROPOSAL_SCRIPT_DIR> --metadata-url <METADATA_URL>

```
This will generate a new proposal number (e.g. `1`), which all other validators need to be able to vote successfully.


for example, from this repository path:

```
libra txs governance propose --proposal-script-dir ./proposals/up-004/1-libra-framework/ --metadata-url https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/upgrades/blob/main/proposals/up-0004/up-0004.md
```



2. VOTE: 2/3rds of validators can vote on the proposal


`libra txs vote --proposal-id <NUMBER>`

for example:

`libra txs vote --proposal-id 1`



3. RESOLVE: If passed, any user can sign and submit the upgrade script
```
libra txs governance resolve --proposal-id <PROPOSAL_ID> --proposal-script-dir <PROPOSAL_SCRIPT_DIR>

```

for example:
`libra txs governance resolve --proposal-id --proposal-script-dir  ./proposals/up-0004/1-libra-framework`

##### Verify the script
Anyone can regenerate the script and hash with:

```
libra move framework upgrade --output-dir <any dir> --framework-local-dir <path to move source> --core-modules libra-framework --danger-force-upgrade`
```

for example:

`libra move framework upgrade -o ~/upgrade-four -f ~/libra-framework/framework --core-modules libra-framework --danger-force-upgrade`

## Validator Node

Upgrades include security patches and performance optimizations. All validators are encouraged to upgrade immediately (and may do so prior to the voting).

### Environment
Building from source requires at least Rust 1.78.0.

```
rustup install 1.78.0
rustup default 1.78.0
```


#### Get the release source at `release-7.0.3`
```
# assumes you have a clone of the repo locally
# git clone https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/libra-framework

git checkout release-7.0.3

cd libra-framework

cargo build --release -p libra --locked
# ...life is waiting

cp target/release/libra ~/.cargo/bin/

# You may need to make it executable
chmod +x ~/.cargo/bin/libra
```

```
# check the version
libra version

## Troubleshooting

### Git issues
Note: The community canonical repo `main` underwent some renaming of commits, so your commit hashes may diverge.
